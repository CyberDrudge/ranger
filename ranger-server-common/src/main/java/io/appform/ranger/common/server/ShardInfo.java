/*
    An example nodeData with which we have written our ranger-servers. When you write your own servers you could define your own node data!
    The idea of this nodeData is to include an environment (prod/stage etc.) along with the region to indicate the DC you may be running your
    service on. It also additionally contains a livelinessScore, ranging from 0 -> 100 (that you can compute basis your own monitor running) and
    a bunch of tags, so help run an AB or the like should it be desired.
    The iterable interface can be used to implement selectors that use a parseable environment string.
     For example for hierarchical lookups.
